Device Tree for an External Stopwatch
-------------------------------------
Written by Solai Jeyakumar

A simple device-tree and associated kernel driver for
interaction with an external stopwatch using GPIO pins of RPI.


1. Devicce tree  file espclock.dts

   This device interacts with a clock using the clock-en pin to start/stop the clock. 
   After the clock starts an interrupt is received from the clock. External devices
   like ESP32 can be used to simulate  a clock.


2. Associated kernel device driver files are in ./driver

3. An user application to read from the device file in linux.
